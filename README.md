Taking care of yourself one day at a time

https://www.telumire.be/health-journal/index.html

This wiki is a work in progress. My plan is to create a tool that will help to improve the mental and physical well-being of its users.

# Done

- [x] Log daily data for various metrics
- [x] Calculators for weightloss
- [x] Calculator for optimal sleep time
- [x] RSS feed to follow the updates of the tool
- [x] Github comments
- [x] External js for smaller saves

# Doing

- [ ] Cleaning up the tiddlers and creating a first blank wiki to allow testing

# To do

- [ ] Greatly improve the UI
- [ ] Use the local storage to store the data, to be able to use the wiki without downloading it/special tools (or maybe save the data in url ?)
- [ ] Meal analyser
- [ ] Workout analyser
- [ ] Recipe planner
- [ ] Workout planner
- [ ] Track BP, and other blood investigations results ([similar](https://phrdemo.tiddlyhost.com/))
- [ ] Habit Tracking 
- [ ] Improve the writing experience for using this as a personnal blog
- [ ] Create a dedicated theme
- [ ] Created a dedicated set of plugin
- [ ] Theme / Plugin library

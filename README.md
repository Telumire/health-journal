Taking care of yourself one day at a time

https://www.telumire.be/health-journal/index.html

This wiki is a work in progress. My plan is to create a tool that will help to improve the mental and physical well-being of its users.

#Current features

* Log daily data for various metrics
* Calculators for weightloss
* Calculator for optimal sleep time
* RSS feed to follow the updates of the tool
* Github comments
* External js for smaller saves

#Planned

* Greatly improve the UI
* Use the local storage to store the data, to be able to use the wiki without downloading it/special tools (or maybe save the data in url ?)
* Meal analyser
* Workout analyser
* Recipe planner
* Workout planner
* Improve the writing experience for using this as a personnal blog

#Your features

Want something to be added to the list ? Issues are welcome :)
